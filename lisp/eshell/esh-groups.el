Directory navigation involves changing directories, examining the

This module allows for special keybindings that only take effect

C-a to move to the beginning of the input text (rather than just the
beginning of the line), and C-p and C-n to move through the input
history, C-u kills the current input text, etc.  It also, if
`eshell-confine-point-to-input' is non-nil, does not allow certain
commands to cause the point to leave the input area, such as
`backward-word', `previous-line', etc.  This module intends to mimic
the behavior of normal shells while the user editing new input text." :tag "Rebind keys at input" :group (quote eshell-module))

aliases implemented in Lisp.  These include mv, ln, cp, rm, etc.  If
the user passes arguments which are too complex, or are unrecognized
by the Lisp variant, the external version will be called (if

usually much slower.  But in several cases their tight integration
with Eshell makes them more versatile than their traditional cousins

by name)." :tag "UNIX commands in Lisp" :group (quote eshell-module))
