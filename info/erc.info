   It comes with the following capabilities enabled by default.

   * Flood control

   * Timestamps

   * Join channels automatically

   * Buttonize URLs, nicknames, and other text

   * Wrap long lines

   * Highlight or remove IRC control characters

   * Highlight pals, fools, and other keywords

2 Getting Started
*****************

The command `M-x erc' will start ERC and prompt for the server to
connect to.

   If you want to place ERC settings in their own file, you can place
them in `~/.emacs.d/.ercrc.el', creating it if necessary.

   If you would rather use the Customize interface to change how ERC
works, do `M-x customize-group RET erc RET'.  In particular, ERC comes
with lots of modules that may be enabled or disabled; to select which
ones you want, do `M-x customize-variable RET erc-modules RET'.

* Sample Session::              Example of connecting to the #emacs channel
* Special Features::            Differences from standalone IRC clients


File: erc.info,  Node: Sample Session,  Next: Special Features,  Up: Getting Started

2.1 Sample Session
==================

This is an example ERC session which shows how to connect to the #emacs
channel on Freenode.  Another IRC channel on Freenode that may be of
interest is #erc, which is a channel where ERC users and developers hang
out.

   * Connect to Freenode

     Run `M-x erc'.  Use "irc.freenode.net" as the IRC server, "6667"
     as the port, and choose a nickname.

   * Get used to the interface

     Switch to the "irc.freenode.net:6667" buffer, if you're not already
     there.  You will see first some messages about checking for ident,
     and then a bunch of other messages that describe the current IRC
     server.

   * Join the #emacs channel

     In that buffer, type "/join SPC #emacs" and hit `RET'.  Depending
     on how you've set up ERC, either a new buffer for "#emacs" will be
     displayed, or a new buffer called "#emacs" will be created in the
     background.  If the latter, switch to the "#emacs" buffer.  You
     will see the channel topic and a list of the people who are
     currently on the channel.

   * Register your nickname with Freenode

     If you would like to be able to talk with people privately on the
     Freenode network, you will have to "register" your nickname.  To do
     so, switch to the "irc.freenode.net:6667" buffer and type "/msg
     NickServ register <password>", replacing "<password>" with your
     desired password.  It should tell you that the operation was
     successful.

   * Talk to people in the channel

     If you switch back to the "#emacs" buffer, you can type a message,
     and everyone on the channel will see it.

   * Open a query buffer to talk to someone

     If you want to talk with someone in private (this should usually
     not be done for technical help, only for personal questions), type
     "/query <nick>", replacing "<nick>" with the nickname of the
     person you would like to talk to.  Depending on how ERC is set up,
     you will either see a new buffer with the name of the person, or
     such a buffer will be created in the background and you will have
     to switch to it.  Begin typing messages, and you will be able to
     have a conversation.

     Note that if the other person is not registered, you will not be
     able to talk with them.

2.2 Special Features
====================

ERC has some features that distinguish it from some IRC clients.

   * multiple channels and multiple servers

     Every channel is put in a separate buffer.  Several IRC servers
     may be connected to at the same time.

   * private message separation

     Private conversations are treated as channels, and are put into
     separate buffers in Emacs.  We call these "query buffers".

   * highlighting

     Some occurrences of words can be highlighted, which makes it
     easier to track different kinds of conversations.

   * notification

     ERC can notify you that certain users are online.

   * channel tracking

     Channels can be hidden and conversation continue in the
     background.  You are notified when something is said in such a
     channel that is not currently visible.  This makes it easy to get
     Real Work done while still maintaining an IRC presence.

   * nick completion

     ERC can complete words upon hitting `TAB', which eases the writing
     of nicknames in messages.

   * history

     Past actions are kept in history rings for future use.  To
     navigate a history ring, hit `M-p' to go backwards and `M-n' to go
     forwards.

   * multiple languages

     Different channels and servers may have different language
     encodings.

     In addition, it is possible to translate the messages that ERC
     uses into multiple languages.  Please contact the developers of
     ERC at <erc-discuss@gnu.org> if you are interested in helping with
     the translation effort.

   * user scripting

     Users can load scripts (e.g., auto greeting scripts) when ERC
     starts up.

     It is also possible to make custom IRC commands, if you know a
     little Emacs Lisp.  Just make an Emacs Lisp function and call it
     `erc-cmd-NEWCOMMAND', where `NEWCOMMAND' is the name of the new
     command in capital letters.

   * auto reconnect

     If the connection goes away at some point, ERC will try to
     reconnect automatically.  If it fails to reconnect, and you want
     to try to manually reestablish the connection at some later point,
     switch to an ERC  buffer and run the `/RECONNECT' command.

5.1 Connecting to an IRC Server
===============================

The easiest way to connect to an IRC server is to call `M-x erc'.  If
you want to assign this function to a keystroke, the following will
help you figure out its parameters.

 -- Function: erc
     Select connection parameters and run ERC.  Non-interactively, it
     takes the following keyword arguments.

        * SERVER

        * PORT

        * NICK

        * PASSWORD

        * FULL-NAME

     That is, if called with the following arguments, SERVER and
     FULL-NAME will be set to those values, whereas `erc-compute-port',
     `erc-compute-nick' and `erc-compute-full-name' will be invoked for
     the values of the other parameters.

          (erc :server "irc.freenode.net" :full-name "Harry S Truman")

Server
------

 -- Function: erc-compute-server &optional server
     Return an IRC server name.

     This tries a number of increasingly more default methods until a
     non-`nil' value is found.

        * SERVER (the argument passed to this function)

        * The `erc-server' option

        * The value of the IRCSERVER environment variable

        * The `erc-default-server' variable


 -- User Option: erc-server
     IRC server to use if one is not provided.

Port
----

 -- Function: erc-compute-port &optional port
     Return a port for an IRC server.

     This tries a number of increasingly more default methods until a
     non-`nil' value is found.

        * PORT (the argument passed to this function)

        * The `erc-port' option

        * The `erc-default-port' variable


 -- User Option: erc-port
     IRC port to use if not specified.

     This can be either a string or a number.

Nick
----

 -- Function: erc-compute-nick &optional nick
     Return user's IRC nick.

     This tries a number of increasingly more default methods until a
     non-`nil' value is found.

        * NICK (the argument passed to this function)

        * The `erc-nick' option

        * The value of the IRCNICK environment variable

        * The result from the `user-login-name' function


 -- User Option: erc-nick
     Nickname to use if one is not provided.

     This can be either a string, or a list of strings.  In the latter
     case, if the first nick in the list is already in use, other nicks
     are tried in the list order.

 -- User Option: erc-nick-uniquifier
     The string to append to the nick if it is already in use.

 -- User Option: erc-try-new-nick-p
     If the nickname you chose isn't available, and this option is
     non-`nil', ERC should automatically attempt to connect with
     another nickname.

     You can manually set another nickname with the /NICK command.

Password
--------

 -- User Option: erc-prompt-for-password
     If non-`nil' (the default), `M-x erc' prompts for a password.

   If you prefer, you can set this option to `nil' and use the
`auth-source' mechanism to store your password.  For instance, if you
use `~/.authinfo' as your auth-source backend, then put something like
the following in that file:

     machine irc.example.net login "#fsf" password sEcReT

ERC also consults `auth-source' to find any channel keys required for
the channels that you wish to autojoin, as specified by the variable
`erc-autojoin-channels-alist'.

   For more details, *note auth-source: (auth)Top.

Full name
---------

 -- Function: erc-compute-full-name &optional full-name
     Return user's full name.

     This tries a number of increasingly more default methods until a
     non-`nil' value is found.

        * FULL-NAME (the argument passed to this function)

        * The `erc-user-full-name' option

        * The value of the IRCNAME environment variable

        * The result from the `user-full-name' function


 -- User Option: erc-user-full-name
     User full name.

     This can be either a string or a function to call.

5.2 Sample Configuration
========================

Here is an example of configuration settings for ERC.  This can go into
your Emacs configuration file.  Everything after the `(require 'erc)'
command can optionally go into `~/.emacs.d/.ercrc.el'.

     ;;; Sample ERC configuration

     ;; Add the ERC directory to load path -- you don't need this if you are
     ;; using the version of ERC that comes with Emacs
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/erc")

     ;; Load ERC
     (require 'erc)

     ;; Load authentication info from an external source.  Put sensitive
     ;; passwords and the like in here.
     (load "~/.emacs.d/.erc-auth")

     ;; This is an example of how to make a new command.  Type "/uptime" to
     ;; use it.
     (defun erc-cmd-UPTIME (&rest ignore)
       "Display the uptime of the system, as well as some load-related
     stuff, to the current ERC buffer."
       (let ((uname-output
              (replace-regexp-in-string
               ", load average: " "] {Load average} ["
               ;; Collapse spaces, remove
               (replace-regexp-in-string
                " +" " "
                ;; Remove beginning and trailing whitespace
                (replace-regexp-in-string
                 "^ +\\|[ \n]+$" ""
                 (shell-command-to-string "uptime"))))))
         (erc-send-message
          (concat "{Uptime} [" uname-output "]"))))

     ;; This causes ERC to connect to the Freenode network upon hitting
     ;; C-c e f.  Replace MYNICK with your IRC nick.
     (global-set-key "\C-cef" (lambda () (interactive)
                                (erc :server "irc.freenode.net" :port "6667"
                                     :nick "MYNICK")))

     ;; This causes ERC to connect to the IRC server on your own machine (if
     ;; you have one) upon hitting C-c e b.  Replace MYNICK with your IRC
     ;; nick.  Often, people like to run bitlbee (http://bitlbee.org/) as an
     ;; AIM/Jabber/MSN to IRC gateway, so that they can use ERC to chat with
     ;; people on those networks.
     (global-set-key "\C-ceb" (lambda () (interactive)
                                (erc :server "localhost" :port "6667"
                                     :nick "MYNICK")))

     ;; Make C-c RET (or C-c C-RET) send messages instead of RET.  This has
     ;; been commented out to avoid confusing new users.
     ;; (define-key erc-mode-map (kbd "RET") nil)
     ;; (define-key erc-mode-map (kbd "C-c RET") 'erc-send-current-line)
     ;; (define-key erc-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-RET") 'erc-send-current-line)

     ;;; Options

     ;; Join the #emacs and #erc channels whenever connecting to Freenode.
     (setq erc-autojoin-channels-alist '(("freenode.net" "#emacs" "#erc")))

     ;; Interpret mIRC-style color commands in IRC chats
     (setq erc-interpret-mirc-color t)

     ;; The following are commented out by default, but users of other
     ;; non-Emacs IRC clients might find them useful.
     ;; Kill buffers for channels after /part
     ;; (setq erc-kill-buffer-on-part t)
     ;; Kill buffers for private queries after quitting the server
     ;; (setq erc-kill-queries-on-quit t)
     ;; Kill buffers for server messages after quitting the server
     ;; (setq erc-kill-server-buffer-on-quit t)

5.3 Options
===========

This section is extremely incomplete.  For now, the easiest way to
check out all the available options for ERC is to do `M-x
customize-group erc RET'.

 -- User Option: erc-hide-list
     If non, `nil', this is a list of IRC message types to hide, e.g.:

          (setq erc-hide-list '("JOIN" "PART" "QUIT"))

 -- User Option: erc-lurker-hide-list
     Like `erc-hide-list', but only applies to messages sent by
     lurkers.  The function `erc-lurker-p' determines whether a given
     nickname is considerd a lurker.

7 History
*********

ERC was originally written by Alexander L. Belikoff <abel@bfr.co.il>
and Sergey Berezin <sergey.berezin@cs.cmu.edu>.  They stopped
development around December 1999.  Their last released version was ERC
2.0.

   P.S.: If one of the original developers of ERC reads this, we'd like
to receive additional information for this file and hear comments in
general.

   * 2001

     In June 2001, Mario Lang <mlang@delysid.org> and Alex Schroeder
     <alex@gnu.org> took over development and created a ERC Project at
     `http://sourceforge.net/projects/erc'.

     In reaction to a mail about the new ERC development effort, Sergey
     Berezin said, "First of all, I'm glad that my version of ERC is
     being used out there.  The thing is, I do not have free time and
     enough incentive anymore to work on ERC, so I would be happy if
     you guys take over the project entirely."

     So we happily hacked away on ERC, and soon after (September 2001)
     released the next "stable" version, 2.1.

     Most of the development of the new ERC happened on #emacs on
     irc.openprojects.net.  Over time, many people contributed code,
     ideas, bugfixes, and a lot of alpha/beta/gamma testing.

     See the `CREDITS' file for a list of contributors.

   * 2003

     ERC 3.0 was released.

   * 2004

     ERC 4.0 was released.

   * 2005

     ERC 5.0 was released.  Michael Olson <mwolson@gnu.org> became the
     release manager and eventually the maintainer.

     After some discussion between him and the Emacs developers, it was
     decided to include ERC in Emacs.

   * 2006

     ERC 5.1 was released.  It was subsequently included in Emacs 22.

     ERC became an official GNU project, and development moved to
     `http://sv.gnu.org/projects/erc'.  We switched to using GNU Arch as
     our revision control system.  Our mailing list address changed as
     well.

   * 2007

     We switched to using git for our version control system.

   * 2009+

     Since about 2009, ERC is no longer developed as a separate
     project, but is maintained as part of Emacs.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008, 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
